# Real-time Chat App

Real time chat app with my personalized interface. Using React for front end, a Node, Express backend and Harper database for storing messages. 

In order to run this on your local, clone this repository onto your local computer. As I used Harper database, you will have to use Harper studio service and create your own account to connect this project. After creating your [Harper account](https://harperdb.io/), create your instance, and put your URL and Password for that instance into a .env file in the back-end folder. Finally, you should create a scheme and a table for your realtime chat app and messages. That it is, you are set.

Also, this project runs on React, so make sure you have your Nodejs installed, there are turtorials to run a React file in the front-end folder.
Have fun.
